**Thread 1/5** üßµ
üöÄ Just launched GOSS-CLI v1.0.0 - the universal CLI for AI models!

Works with:
‚úÖ LM Studio (local)
‚úÖ Ollama (local)  
‚úÖ OpenAI (cloud)
‚úÖ LocalAI (self-hosted)
‚úÖ Any OpenAI-compatible API

One CLI, any model. No vendor lock-in. üîó

**Thread 2/5**
Built for developers who are tired of learning different CLIs for each AI provider.

```bash
npm install -g goss-cli

# Same interface, different providers
goss "Hello world"                    # LM Studio
goss --provider ollama "Code review"  # Ollama  
goss --provider openai "Complex task" # OpenAI
```

**Thread 3/5**
üî• Key features:
‚Ä¢ Save & resume conversations
‚Ä¢ Auto-detect providers
‚Ä¢ Cross-platform (Mac/Linux/Windows)
‚Ä¢ Streaming responses
‚Ä¢ 18 test cases
‚Ä¢ MIT licensed

Perfect for local AI enthusiasts and cloud users alike!

**Thread 4/5**
Example workflow:
```bash
# Start with local model
goss --save "Design a REST API"

# Switch to cloud for complex reasoning  
goss --provider openai --context-file logs/chat.txt "Now add auth"

# Back to local for code generation
goss --provider ollama "Implement the endpoints"
```

**Thread 5/5**
Built by developers, for developers who actually use AI models daily.

**Title:** [Tool] Universal CLI for Local AI Models - Works with LM Studio, Ollama, and more

Hey LocalLLaMA community! üëã

I built **GOSS-CLI** because I was tired of remembering different commands for different AI tools. It's a universal CLI that works with:

- **LM Studio** (default) - Just works with your loaded models
- **Ollama** - Seamlessly integrates with your local setup
- **OpenAI** - For when you need GPT-4 power
- **LocalAI** - Self-hosted OpenAI-compatible APIs
- **Custom APIs** - Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

**Quick start:**
```bash
npm install -g goss-cli
goss "Explain transformer architecture"  # Uses LM Studio by default
```

**Cool features:**
- Save conversations to timestamped files
- Resume previous chats with `--context-file`
- Auto-detects your provider (no config needed)
- Cross-platform (tested on Mac/Linux/Windows)

Perfect for folks running local models who occasionally need cloud APIs. No vendor lock-in!

**Links:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/your-username/GOSS-CLI  
- npm: `npm install -g goss-cli`
- 18 test cases, MIT licensed, production-ready

Would love feedback from the community! üöÄ

### r/commandline  
**Title:** Universal CLI for AI models - switch between LM Studio, Ollama, OpenAI seamlessly

Built this CLI tool for developers working with multiple AI providers. Same interface, different backends:

```bash
goss "Hello world"                    # Local (LM Studio)
goss --provider ollama "Code review"  # Ollama
goss --provider openai "Complex task" # OpenAI
```

Key features:
- Auto-detects provider from endpoint
- Save/resume conversations
- Streaming responses
- Cross-platform
- Comprehensive error handling

Tired of learning different CLIs for each AI service? This might help!

npm: `npm install -g goss-cli`

### Hacker News
**Title:** Show HN: Universal CLI for AI models (LM Studio, Ollama, OpenAI)

I built GOSS-CLI because I was frustrated switching between different command-line tools for different AI providers. 

It provides a unified interface that works with:
- Local models (LM Studio, Ollama, LocalAI)
- Cloud APIs (OpenAI, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
- Auto-detection based on your API endpoint

The architecture uses a provider abstraction layer, making it easy to add new AI services. It handles streaming responses, conversation persistence, and has comprehensive error recovery.

Key differentiator: You can start a conversation with a local model and seamlessly continue it with a cloud API, or vice versa. Perfect for cost-conscious development workflows.

Built with Node.js, 18 test cases, MIT licensed. Ready for production use.

üöÄ **Excited to share: GOSS-CLI v1.0.0 is now live!**

As AI becomes central to development workflows, I noticed developers struggling with different CLIs for different providers. So I built a universal solution.

**GOSS-CLI** provides one interface for:
‚úÖ Local models (LM Studio, Ollama)
‚úÖ Cloud APIs (OpenAI, custom endpoints)  
‚úÖ Conversation persistence across providers
‚úÖ Cross-platform compatibility

**Why this matters:**
‚Ä¢ **Cost optimization** - Start local, scale to cloud when needed
‚Ä¢ **Developer experience** - One CLI to learn, not five
‚Ä¢ **Flexibility** - No vendor lock-in, switch providers seamlessly
‚Ä¢ **Privacy** - Keep sensitive conversations local

Built with comprehensive testing, error handling, and documentation. Ready for enterprise use.

**Try it:** `npm install -g goss-cli`

**Subject:** Universal CLI for AI Models - GOSS-CLI v1.0.0 Launch

Hi [Name],

I wanted to share a tool I've been working on that might interest your audience.

**GOSS-CLI** is a universal command-line interface for AI models that works with both local and cloud providers. Instead of learning different CLIs for LM Studio, Ollama, OpenAI, etc., developers can use one consistent interface.

**Key benefits:**
- Start conversations locally, continue in the cloud (or vice versa)
- Auto-detects providers, minimal configuration
- Conversation persistence and resume functionality  
- Cross-platform, comprehensive testing
- MIT licensed, production-ready

It's particularly useful for:
- Developers building AI-powered applications
- Teams that use both local and cloud models
- Anyone wanting to avoid vendor lock-in

The tool just hit v1.0.0 with full documentation and testing.
